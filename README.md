## ‚öôÔ∏è **Prerequisites and Installation**

To start working with ``AWS Glue`` using ``Boto3``, you need to set up your Python environment on your laptop.  
  
In summary, this is what you will need:
- Python 3
- Boto3
- AWS CLI tools
- virtualenv

&nbsp; 

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv

#Test your installation:
$ virtualenv --version

# Create your virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv .venv-aws-glue

# you can activate the virtual environment by just input
source .venv-aws-glue/bin/activate

# then you can deactivate it by just type in deactivate.
source .venv-aws-glue/bin/deactivate

# If you want to delete that virtual env, simply do
rm -rf .venv-aws-glue
```

&nbsp; 

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
